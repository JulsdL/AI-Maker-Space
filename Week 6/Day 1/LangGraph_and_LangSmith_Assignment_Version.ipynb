        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate appliation flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

This results in a regular pattern of brightness variations, with the total brightness of the system changing as one star passes in front of the other.\\n\\nEclipsing binaries are important in astronomy because they allow astronomers to determine the physical properties of the stars, such as their sizes, masses, and temperatures, by analyzing the light curves during the eclipses. This information can provide valuable insights into the nature of the stars and their evolution.\\n\\nThere are different types of eclipsing binaries, including detached binaries, semi-detached binaries, and contact binaries, depending on the proximity of the stars and the degree of interaction between them. Eclipsing binaries are commonly studied to understand stellar evolution, binary star formation, and other astrophysical phenomena.'"

Here are some reasons why eclipsing binaries are significant:\\n\\n1. **Determination of Stellar Parameters**: Eclipsing binaries consist of two stars that orbit each other in such a way that they periodically eclipse each other as seen from Earth. By studying the light curve of these eclipses, astronomers can determine the sizes, masses, temperatures, and luminosities of the stars in the binary system. This information helps in understanding the fundamental properties of stars.\\n\\n2. **Distance Measurements**: Eclipsing binaries can be used to determine distances to star clusters and galaxies. By measuring the apparent brightness of the stars in the binary system and comparing it to their known intrinsic brightness, astronomers can calculate the distance to the system using the inverse square law of light.\\n\\n3. **Testing Stellar Evolution Models**: Eclipsing binaries provide a unique opportunity to test stellar evolution models. By comparing the observed properties of the stars in a binary system with the predictions of theoretical models, astronomers can improve our understanding of how stars evolve over time.\\n\\n4. **Studying Stellar Variability**: Eclipsing binaries exhibit variations in their light curves due to the eclipses and other phenomena such as star spots and pulsations. Studying these variations can provide insights into the internal structure and dynamics of stars.\\n\\n5. **Detection of Exoplanets**: Eclipsing binaries can also be used to detect exoplanets orbiting around one of the stars in the binary system. The presence of a planet can cause additional variations in the light curve, allowing astronomers to infer the existence of the exoplanet.\\n\\nOverall, eclipsing binaries play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of stellar astrophysics and are valuable tools for making precise astronomical measurements.',\n",

By measuring the depth and duration of the eclipses, astronomers can calculate the radii of the stars.\\n\\n3. **Stellar Masses**: The masses of the stars in the binary system can be determined by studying the orbital dynamics of the system, as well as the timing and shape of the eclipses in the light curve.\\n\\n4. **Stellar Luminosities**: By combining information about the radii and temperatures of the stars in the binary system, astronomers can calculate the luminosities of the stars. This can provide insights into the evolutionary stage of the stars.\\n\\n5. **Temperature and Composition**: The light curve can also reveal information about the temperature and composition of the stars in the binary system.
