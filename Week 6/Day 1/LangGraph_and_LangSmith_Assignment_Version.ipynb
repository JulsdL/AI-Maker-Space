        "### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effetively allowing us to recreate appliation flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

This results in a regular pattern of brightness variations, known as light curves, as the stars pass in front of each other. Eclipsing binaries are important in astronomy because they allow astronomers to determine the physical properties of the stars, such as their sizes, masses, and temperatures, by analyzing the light curves.

This could lead to lower scores even when the response effectively addresses the question with equivalent but differently phrased terms. Instead of a \"must_mention\" we could use a \"same_meaning\" approach. This would allow for a more flexible evaluation that considers the meaning of the terms used in the response rather than the exact terms themselves. We could use the string_distance evaluator as well. At last, we could make sure to ignore case sensitivity and punctuation in the evaluation."

Here are some reasons why eclipsing binaries are important:\\n\\n1. **Determination of stellar parameters**: Eclipsing binaries consist of two stars that orbit each other in such a way that they periodically eclipse each other as seen from Earth. By studying the light curve of these eclipses, astronomers can determine the sizes, masses, temperatures, and luminosities of the stars in the binary system. This information helps in understanding the fundamental properties of stars.\\n\\n2. **Testing stellar models**: Eclipsing binaries provide a unique opportunity to test theoretical models of stellar structure and evolution. By comparing the observed properties of the stars in eclipsing binaries with the predictions of stellar models, astronomers can improve our understanding of stellar evolution.\\n\\n3. **Distance measurements**: Eclipsing binaries can be used as standard candles to determine distances to star clusters and galaxies. By measuring the brightness of the stars in the binary system and comparing it to their known intrinsic luminosities, astronomers can calculate the distance to the system and, by extension, to the surrounding objects.\\n\\n4. **Stellar variability**: Eclipsing binaries exhibit variations in their light curves due to factors such as stellar activity, pulsations, and other phenomena. Studying these variations can provide insights into the internal structure and dynamics of stars.\\n\\n5. **Exoplanet detection**: Eclipsing binaries can also be used to detect exoplanets. When a planet passes in front of one of the stars in the binary system, it causes additional dimming in the light curve. By studying these transit events, astronomers can identify and characterize exoplanets orbiting the stars.\\n\\nOverall, eclipsing binaries play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of stellar astrophysics, testing theoretical models, and making important astronomical measurements.',\n",

Here are some key insights that can be obtained from studying the light curves of eclipsing binaries:\\n\\n1. **Binary System Parameters**: By analyzing the light curve, astronomers can determine the orbital period of the binary system, the sizes and shapes of the stars, the distance between the stars, and the inclination of the orbital plane.\\n\\n2. **Stellar Properties**: The light curve can provide information about the individual stars in the binary system, such as their masses, radii, temperatures, and luminosities. This can help astronomers understand the evolutionary stage of the stars.\\n\\n3. **Eclipses**: Eclipsing binaries exhibit periodic dips in brightness when one star passes in front of the other (primary eclipse) or when both stars pass in front of each other (secondary eclipse). The depth and duration of these eclipses can reveal the relative sizes and temperatures of the stars.\\n\\n4. **Temperature Variations**: The light curve can show variations in brightness due to temperature differences between the stars. This can provide insights into the surface temperatures and atmospheres of the stars.\\n\\n5. **Period Changes**: Studying the light curve over time can reveal changes in the orbital period of the binary system, which can be caused by factors such as mass transfer between the stars or gravitational interactions with a third body.\\n\\n6. **Stellar Evolution**: Eclipsing binaries are valuable for studying stellar evolution, as the changes in brightness and other parameters over time can help astronomers understand how stars evolve and interact in binary systems.\\n\\nOverall, the light curves of eclipsing binaries provide a wealth of information about the properties and dynamics of binary star systems, making them important objects of study in astronomy.',\n",

This results in a periodic decrease in the system's overall brightness when one star passes in front of the other.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Detached Eclipsing Binaries**: In this type, the two stars are well-separated and do not interact with each other. Both stars have their own Roche lobes and do not transfer mass between them.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Semi-Detached Eclipsing Binaries**: In this type, one star fills its Roche lobe while the other does not. The star that fills its Roche lobe is called the donor star, and it transfers mass to the other star, known as the accretor.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Contact Eclipsing Binaries**: In this type, both stars have filled their Roche lobes and are in contact with each other. They share a common envelope of gas and are in close proximity.\n",

            "The orbital plane's inclination affects the observation of eclipses in the following ways:\n",
            "\n",
            "- If the orbital plane is inclined such that it is nearly edge-on to the observer, the eclipses will be total and the stars will completely block each other's light, resulting in a significant decrease in brightness.\n",
            "- If the orbital plane is inclined such that it is nearly face-on to the observer, the eclipses will be partial and the stars will only partially block each other's light, resulting in a smaller decrease in brightness.\n",
            "- The inclination of the orbital plane also affects the duration and frequency of eclipses observed from Earth.\n",
            "\n",
